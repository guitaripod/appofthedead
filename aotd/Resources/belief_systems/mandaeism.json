      "content": "Mandaeism is a deeply dualistic Gnostic religion, positing a stark division between the 'Alma d-Nhura' (World of Light) and the 'Bit Tumia' (World of Darkness). The supreme God, known as 'Hayyi Rabbi' (The Great Life), presides over the light, while the underworld is ruled by the King of Darkness ('Ur'). Humanity's predicament stems from this cosmic struggle. Each human being holds within them a divine spark of light, the soul or 'nishimta', which has been captured and imprisoned in the material world. This world, and the physical body ('pagra'), are seen as creations of a lesser, flawed deity known as Ptahil, who worked with the dark powers of Ruha and the Seven Planets. Therefore, life on Earth is an exile, and death is the critical first step in the 'nishimta's' potential liberation and return to its luminous origin. This journey home is the central drama of Mandaean eschatology.",

This is not a paradise in a human sense, but a return to the origin. The soul is joyfully welcomed by the 'uthras', bathes in the light of the cosmic 'yardnas' (rivers of light), is clothed in a garment of radiance, and is finally reunited with the Great Life, 'Hayyi Rabbi'. In this state, the individual ego dissolves into the boundless light, finding ultimate peace and existence. For those who fail, who are mired in darkness and sin, the fate is grim. They are sent to the 'Bit Tumia', the House of Darkness, a realm of torment ruled by the great dragon 'Ur'. Here they are punished until a final cosmic redemption at the end of the world, when Hibil Ziwa is prophesied to rescue all the sparks of light from the darkness.",
