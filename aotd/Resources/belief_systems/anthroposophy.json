Each stage is believed to develop different aspects of cosmic consciousness. After death, the etheric body (life force) separates over three days, during which a complete life panorama is experienced from others' perspectives. This process generates profound moral understanding as one feels all pain given and joy shared. [cite: 656, 657, 658, 659]",
