      "content": "Shinto views death as the ultimate pollution ('kegare') while simultaneously recognizing it as a transformation that turns the deceased into protective kami. This paradox defines the Japanese approach to mortality. At death, the 'tamashii' (soul/spirit) separates from the body, beginning its transformation into a kami, a process that requires time and proper rituals. The concept of 'kegare' extends beyond death to include various forms of impurity or defilement, both physical and spiritual. These impurities disrupt the harmony between humans and the kami, and must be purified through rituals to restore balance and well-being. This is why death, as a source of extreme kegare, requires specific rituals to manage its disruptive influence.",
