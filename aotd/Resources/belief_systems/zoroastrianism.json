      "content": "In Zoroastrian thought, the human being is a composite entity, with the physical body (tan) being a temporary vessel for several spiritual components. The most central of these is the 'Urvan,' or soul. It is the Urvan that is the seat of consciousness, free will, and moral responsibility; it is the part of the individual that faces judgment after death. Every Urvan is accompanied by a 'Fravashi,' a pre-existent divine guardian spirit or higher self. The Fravashi acts as a spiritual guide and protector throughout life. While the Urvan descends into the material world to fight evil, the Fravashi remains in the spiritual realm as a perfect model. At the end of life, the righteous Urvan is reunited with its Fravashi, achieving a state of wholeness and perfection.",

During this time, the soul contemplates its past life. A righteous soul is said to sit at the head of the body, joyfully chanting the sacred Gathas and experiencing a foretaste of paradise, comforted by angels. Conversely, the wicked soul cowers at the feet, wailing lamentations from the Yasna, tormented by visions of its misdeeds and the punishment to come, harassed by demons. During this period, funeral rites are performed, including the crucial 'Sagdid' ceremony, where a dog is brought before the corpse. The dog's gaze is believed to drive away the 'Druj Nasu,' the corpse demon, and lessen the demonic pollution. This ritual underscores the importance of purity and protection for the departing soul.",

For the wicked, it narrows to the sharp edge of a razor, making passage impossible and causing the soul to tumble into the abyss of hell. Here the soul meets 'Daena,' the personification of its conscience and the sum of its actions. For a righteous soul, Daena appears as a beautiful, fragrant maiden of fifteen, who declares, 'I am your own good thoughts, good words, and good deeds.'

The highest realm is 'Anagra Raocha,' the Realm of Endless Light, where the most righteous souls experience the direct presence of Ahura Mazda. Conversely, 'Druj-o Demana,' the House of Lies (Hell), also has descending levels mirroring these categories: a realm for Evil Thoughts, one for Evil Words, and one for Evil Deeds. The punishments are not arbitrary but directly relate to the sins committed on earth—the cruel experience cruelty, the liar is tormented by deceit.
