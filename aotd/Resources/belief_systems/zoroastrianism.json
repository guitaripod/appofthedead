      "content": "In Zoroastrian thought, the human being is a composite entity, with the physical body (tan) being a temporary vessel for several spiritual components. The most central of these is the 'Urvan,' or soul. It is the Urvan that is the seat of consciousness, free will, and moral responsibility; it is the part of the individual that faces judgment after death. Every Urvan is accompanied by a 'Fravashi,' a pre-existent divine guardian spirit or higher self. The Fravashi acts as a spiritual guide and protector throughout life. While the Urvan descends into the material world to fight evil, the Fravashi remains in the spiritual realm as a perfect model. At the end of life, the righteous Urvan is reunited with its Fravashi, achieving a state of wholeness and perfection.",
