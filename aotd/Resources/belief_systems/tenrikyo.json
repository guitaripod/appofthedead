      "order": 1,
      "content": "Tenrikyo presents a profound and distinct understanding of human existence, centered on the concept of the 'borrowed body.' From the perspective of God the Parent, the ultimate source and sustainer of all life, our physical forms are not truly our own but are graciously lent to us for a finite period, precisely 115 years according to Tenrikyo teachings, though this is an ideal rather than a strict limit. This 'borrowed body' is a precious instrument for living out God's divine intention. Death, then, is not an ending to be feared, but a natural and necessary act of returning this borrowed vessel to God the Parent. It is a 'passing away for rebirth,' signifying a continuous cycle of renewal and spiritual progression. A key factor influencing the duration and quality of life is the accumulation of 'dust in the mind.' This 'dust' refers to negative thoughts, attitudes, and behaviors such as greed, arrogance, hatred, self-love, miserliness, vindictiveness, and covetousness. These mental impurities obscure our innate divine nature and hinder the harmonious operation of our borrowed bodies. When a significant amount of dust accumulates, it can lead to illness, misfortune, and even early death. Conversely, actively sweeping away this dust through sincere introspection, repentance, and practicing virtuous deeds (like giving, assisting others, and showing gratitude) allows us to live in greater accordance with God's will, ensuring a healthier, more joyous life and a smoother transition back to God the Parent. This concept emphasizes human responsibility for their spiritual well-being and the continuous opportunity for self-improvement within the cycle of existence.",

It is described as the soul (or 'tama') detaching from the physical body, which is then returned to God the Parent. This detachment is not an annihilation but a graceful release, akin to a leaf falling from a tree or a child returning home to a loving parent. The period immediately following physical death is often characterized by a state of spiritual continuity, where the departed soul remains under the direct, benevolent care and guidance of God the Parent. There is no concept of judgment or a fixed afterlife destination like heaven or hell in the traditional sense. Instead, the soul is nurtured and prepared for its next incarnation. God the Parent, in infinite parental love and wisdom, orchestrates the conditions for the soul's next rebirth, ensuring it receives a body and circumstances most conducive to its spiritual growth and the fulfillment of the divine intention for humanity. This ensures that every individual is given continuous opportunities to sweep away their accumulated 'dust' and draw closer to the ideal of the 'Joyous Life.' The ultimate goal is not to escape the cycle of rebirth but to purify and perfect one's spirit through successive lives, eventually contributing to the collective spiritual evolution of humanity. This perspective transforms death from a feared end into a hopeful moment of renewal, a vital step in an ongoing journey of learning and spiritual refinement, always within the embrace of God the Parent.",

The 'Joyous Life' is not merely a state of personal happiness, but a collective, communal existence characterized by mutual help, honesty, sincerity, and universal love (hinokishin). It is a world where all humanity lives in perfect harmony, recognizing their shared origin as children of God the Parent. Death, therefore, is intimately connected to this earthly aspiration. The repeated cycles of rebirth are not meant to prolong suffering but to provide endless opportunities for individuals to refine their character, overcome their 'dust,' and learn to live in accordance with God's intention. Every life is a chance to move closer to the ideal of the Joyous Life. The accumulation of good deeds, acts of selfless service (hinokishin), and the sincere effort to purify one's mind contribute directly to fostering the conditions for the Joyous Life, not just for oneself but for all of humanity. Even when individuals experience suffering or early death, it is viewed as a form of divine guidance or parental instruction, prompting them to reflect on their 'dust' and make spiritual adjustments. The suffering itself is not a punishment, but a benevolent nudge towards self-reflection and growth, ultimately aimed at guiding all humanity towards the realization of this perfect, harmonious world on Earth. The 'afterlife,' in Tenrikyo, is therefore a continuous cycle of returning to life until this collective transformation is achieved.",

This ideal world, described as the ultimate manifestation of the Joyous Life, is where all people live in perfect harmony, free from illness, suffering, and conflict, recognizing God the Parent as their common origin. Each individual life, including every rebirth, serves as an indispensable step in this grand, unfolding plan of God the Parent. Successive rebirths are viewed as repeated opportunities for the soul to further purify itself, shed accumulated 'dust,' and cultivate virtues like sincerity, honesty, and mutual aid. Every positive action, every effort to sweep away mental impurities, contributes not only to one's personal spiritual refinement but also, critically, to the collective spiritual maturity of humanity. The divine intention is for humanity to reach a state where it can fully understand and respond to God's will, creating a world where divine providence flows unimpeded. Death, in this context, is simply a momentary pause, a return to God's embrace, before the soul is re-dispatched with a new body and new circumstances, optimally suited to continue its personal and the collective's spiritual journey.

      "order": 5,
      "content": "In Tenrikyo, the journey towards the Joyous Life and the broader collective spiritual evolution is not left to human effort alone. It is profoundly shaped by the constant, benevolent intervention of God the Parent through what is understood as 'divine providence' or 'unseen guidance.' This divine guidance is active in every aspect of existence, manifesting in both subtle and overt ways. Every event, whether seemingly good or bad, is interpreted as a manifestation of God's parental love, serving as a lesson or a nudge to steer humanity towards spiritual refinement. Miracles, though not sought after for their own sake, are considered clear signs of God's active involvement and benevolence, demonstrating the divine power to heal, protect, and guide. These are not supernatural interruptions of natural law, but rather natural workings of God's providence, often perceived as extraordinary due to human limitations in understanding divine workings. For example, a sudden recovery from illness after sincere prayer and introspection, or an unexpected solution to a difficult problem, can be seen as direct expressions of God's guidance. Even suffering, illness, or setbacks—including the experience of death itself—are fundamentally viewed as 'parental guidance' or 'warnings' (oshie) from God the Parent, intended to prompt self-reflection and the 'sweeping away' of 'dust in the mind.' They are not punishments, but compassionate lessons to help individuals correct their attitudes and behaviors, leading them closer to the path of the Joyous Life and contributing to the purification of the world. This understanding instills a profound sense of gratitude and reliance on God the Parent, transforming challenges into opportunities for spiritual growth and reaffirming the continuous, loving relationship between humanity and its divine source, even across the cycles of rebirth.",
