The 'hun' souls (three ethereal aspects) rise toward heaven, carrying consciousness and personality. The 'po' souls (seven corporeal aspects) sink earthward, animating the corpse and potentially becoming troublesome if not properly handled. This understanding underpins elaborate funeral rites, aimed at keeping po souls peaceful while assisting hun souls' ascension. [cite: 566, 567, 568, 569]",
